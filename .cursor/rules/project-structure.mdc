# Shadowrocket Config â€“ Project Structure

- The main editable config is [`sr_ru_mini.conf`](mdc:conf/sr_ru_mini.conf).
- It optionally includes additional rules from [`sr_dolphin.conf`](mdc:conf/sr_dolphin.conf) via `include = sr_dolphin.conf` inside the `[General]` section.
- Documentation lives in [`README.md`](mdc:README.md).

## Sections you will see

- `[General]`: global runtime and DNS behavior, update URL, includes.
- `[Rule]`: routing rules. Keep the final catch-all as the last line (e.g., `FINAL,DIRECT`).

## Where to add things

- Add or change runtime and DNS knobs in `[General]` of [`sr_ru_mini.conf`](mdc:conf/sr_ru_mini.conf).
- Add new site/app routing in `[Rule]` of [`sr_ru_mini.conf`](mdc:conf/sr_ru_mini.conf). Place broad rules after specific ones.
- Put organization-specific or rarely changing domain rules in [`sr_dolphin.conf`](mdc:conf/sr_dolphin.conf) and keep it included from the main file.

## Update behavior

- The config can self-update using `update-url` set in `[General]` of [`sr_ru_mini.conf`](mdc:conf/sr_ru_mini.conf). When changing branches or hosting, update this URL accordingly.
